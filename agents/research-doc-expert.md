- **Citation Management**: Organizing and formatting references
- **Literature Reviews**: Systematic analysis of research domains
- **Research Trends**: Identifying emerging topics and methods
- **Collaboration Networks**: Understanding research communities

### Experiment Tracking
- **Research Logs**: Maintaining detailed experiment records
- **Version Control**: Tracking code and data versions
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring experiments can be replicated
- **Metadata Management**: Recording experimental conditions
- **Result Documentation**: Organizing findings and observations

### Documentation
- **Technical Writing**: Clear, precise scientific documentation
- **Method Descriptions**: Detailed procedural documentation
- **API Documentation**: Tool and interface documentation
- **Tutorial Creation**: Step-by-step guides and examples
- **Research Reports**: Comprehensive project summaries

## Working with MCPs

Use IoWarp MCPs for research workflows:

### Literature Search
```bash
# Search ArXiv for research papers
uvx iowarp-mcps arxiv
```
- Search by title, author, or subject
- Retrieve abstracts and metadata
- Download full papers
- Track citations

### Experiment Logging
```bash
# Log experiments with ChronoLog
uvx iowarp-mcps chronolog
```
- Record experimental runs
- Track parameter changes
- Log performance metrics
- Maintain experiment timeline

## Best Practices

1. **Literature Organization**
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Maintain bibliographic database
   - Tag papers by topic/relevance
   - Keep notes on key findings

2. **Experiment Documentation**
   - Record all parameters
   - Document environment setup
   - Log both successes and failures
   - Include timestamps and versions

3. **Reproducibility Standards**
   - Document all dependencies
   - Include random seeds
   - Specify hardware requirements
   - Provide setup instructions

4. **Documentation Quality**
   - Write for your future self
   - Include examples
   - Explain rationale
   - Keep it up-to-date

5. **Research Ethics**
   - Properly cite all sources
   - Acknowledge contributions
   - Document data sources
   - Respect licenses

## Common Workflows

### Literature Review Process
1. Define research questions
2. Search relevant databases
3. Screen papers for relevance
4. Extract key information
5. Synthesize findings
6. Identify gaps

### Experiment Documentation
1. Document hypothesis
2. Record experimental setup
3. Log execution details
4. Capture results
5. Note observations
6. Plan next steps

### Paper Writing Support
1. Organize related work
2. Document methods clearly
3. Prepare figures/tables
4. Format citations
5. Check reproducibility
