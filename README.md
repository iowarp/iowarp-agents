Specialized AI subagents for scientific computing workflows. Built for Claude Code, designed to be adaptable as other systems develop similar capabilities.

## Overview

IOWarp Agents are task-specific AI assistants that enhance your scientific computing workflow. Each agent specializes in a particular domain, providing expert guidance and leveraging the IOWarp MCP ecosystem when available.

## Available Agents

| Agent | Specialization | Key Features |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **data-io-expert** | Scientific data formats & I/O | HDF5, ADIOS, Parquet, compression |
| **analysis-viz-expert** | Data analysis & visualization | Statistical analysis, plotting, pandas operations |
| **hpc-performance-expert** | HPC & performance optimization | Job scheduling, profiling, resource management |
| **research-doc-expert** | Research & documentation | Literature search, experiment tracking, technical writing |
| **workflow-orchestrator** | Workflow & environment management | Pipeline creation, reproducibility, automation |

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Easy Installation (Recommended)

Use our beautiful CLI tool for the best experience:

```bash
# Install and use with uvx (recommended)
uvx iowarp-agents install

# Or install the CLI globally
pip install iowarp-agents
iowarp-agents install
```

**Interactive Installation Example:**
```bash
$ uvx iowarp-agents install

2) Global installation Install for all projects

‚úÖ Installation Successful!
```

### üìã CLI Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `list` | List all available agents | `uvx iowarp-agents list --detailed` |
| `install` | Install an agent interactively | `uvx iowarp-agents install` |
| `install <agent> <platform> <scope>` | Direct installation | `uvx iowarp-agents install workflow-orchestrator claude local` |

### üì¶ Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

1. **Project-specific agents** (recommended):
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-agents.git

# Copy agents to your project
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp iowarp-agents/agents/*.md .claude/agents/
```

2. **Global agents** (for all projects):
```bash
# Copy to user-level directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp iowarp-agents/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Usage in Claude Code

Once installed, agents are automatically available. Invoke them using:

```
/agents
```

Or use natural language:
- "Use the data-io-expert to help me convert this HDF5 file to Parquet"
- "I need the hpc-performance-expert to optimize my SLURM job"

## Agent Capabilities

- Workflow tools (Snakemake, Nextflow)
- Reproducible workflows

## Integration with IOWarp MCPs

These agents are designed to work seamlessly with [IOWarp MCPs](https://github.com/iowarp/iowarp-mcps) when available in your project:

```bash
# Install IOWarp MCPs
pip install iowarp-mcps

# Agents will automatically utilize available MCPs
uvx iowarp-mcps pandas  # Used by analysis-viz-expert
uvx iowarp-mcps slurm   # Used by hpc-performance-expert
```

## Creating Custom Agents

Create your own agents by following this template:

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Brief description of when to use this agent
tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, LS, Task
---

You are a [Role] Expert specialized in [domain].

## Core Expertise
